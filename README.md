# Detect-Juventus-Ticket-Availability-Python
This is a python script I made that sent me an email as soon as tickets were available to watch the soccer game Juventus against Milan

To realize this Python script, I scrapped Milan AC website in Python every minutes and decide to send or not an email if the script detects that new tickets are available for the game.
